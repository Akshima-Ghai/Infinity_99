# TEAM_NAME -> Infinity_99
# PROJECT_NAME -> ATHENA
# BASIC IDEA BEHIND OUR PROJECT : 
                                Athena is another name of goddess Saraswati , so basically our idea revolves around the education system .
                                Our project basically provides an environment to the educational community to take exams . During the                                       COVID-19 pandemic . One of the greatest issues institutions are facing that they are unable to conduct                                     examinations to check the understanding of the student . So basically from our project they can conduct                                     online examinations without any cheating or other activities . It's kind a great initiative for the                                         development of online platform especially for conducting exams , which is not very practical before our                                     project was introduced . But guess what Technology can do anything with great minds , we just need an                                       initiative .

# PROJECT_NAME -> ATHENA
BASIC IDEA BEHIND OUR PROJECT : A simple video collaboration app especially designed for student examination purposes,ensuring all disciplinary measures. "ATHENA",an android application made using android studio and uses kotlin as backend and xml for developing UI. This app uses firebase for phone number authentification via OTP followed by a splash screen.It uses Quickblox libraries and sdk's for video conferencing,the minimum API level is 16 and hence it is comptible with most of the android versions. It allows video conferencing features for multiple users simultaneously,since solely designed for examination ,once the call activity starts ,after any student presses home button or tries to switch screen a warning message is displayed.After ,three consecutive warnings the student is pushed out of the examination,ensuring complete disciplinary environment for any examination.
